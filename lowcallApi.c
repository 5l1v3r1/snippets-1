	->call api's in 32bit OS
	->call api's in 64bit OS

	Since this is a low level procedure no error checking is done for maximum speed
	error checking should be implemented before calling this Api set

	This type of api calling bypasses
	all forms of usermode sandbox which utilize
	inline,EAT,IAT and other forms of hooking
	including cuckoo, sandboxie, anubis etc.
	except ring0 hooks
	->SSDT
	->kernel hooks
	->Driver Inline Hooks
	->and more
	
	
uses:
detect ring3 rootkits
detect ring3 sandboxes
no need for usermode unhooking
