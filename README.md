pieces of code i wrote several years ago but only got time now to put them in a repo.
As time goes on and i explore my old HDD i will keep on adding more pieces of junk.
And adding more code as i find time to write further dirty hacks.
people struggling to find low level code, RE'd Hooks, small tricks might find it useful.
feel free to optimize, indent, point out mistakes
